  <summary><h3>🏞️ My Coding Journey 🏞️</h3></summary>
Born and raised in Johannesburg South Africa 🇿🇦. I have always been drawn to computers since I was young. Whether it was playing Counter Strike Source with my cousins at their LAN parties or learning every corner of how Windows XP works, I would always find myself in front of a computer screen being entertained for hours. 

At the age of 12 I was given my first ever computer for my birthday and officially became the IT geek of the family house, fixing any issues related to the internet or with my family computer. 

In 2014, I started my first ever IT classes in my Grade 10 year and began to learn how to code with Java. In those first few classes I knew instantly that this is what I wanted to do with my future and began my journey of many hours climbing that learning curve of coding, debugging and computer theory. 

Once I matriculated in 2016, I was accepted into the University of Johannesburg where I began my BSc Computer Science journey. In 2019 I moved to the University of Pretoria to complete my studies. 

In 2022 I took my official gap year and started freelancing my software skills. I was hired by [RIC](http://ricgroup.net/) to work on a solo project known: The [BGO Tool](https://github.com/littlevegasdavids/RIC-BGO-Tool).
  
I then moved onto my first passion project [Shop Emporium](https://github.com/littlevegasdavids/Shop-Emporium) where I created an ecommerce shop from scratch for [Emporium of Curiosity](https://www.instagram.com/emporiumofcuriosity/).
  
In December 2022 I graduated as a Bacheolor of Science in Computer Science.
  
In April 2023 I moved to Cape Town and joined a 6 month Software Engineer graduate program at [SovTech](https://www.sovtech.co.za/). In October 2023 I got promoted to Junior Software Developer at SovTech. 

In June 2024 I passed the exam for the AWS Certified Developer - Associate and got my first [certificate](https://www.credly.com/badges/cc31cf30-d9ab-4160-bdff-f92dae635cea/public_url). In September 2024 I was promoted to Mid-Level Software Engineer 3.
