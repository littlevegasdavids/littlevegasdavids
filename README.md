**`Software Engineer / Full-Stack Engineer`**
Born and raised in Johannesburg South Africa 🇿🇦 since 1997.  I have always been drawn to computers since I was a young age of 6 years old. Whether it would be playing Counter Strike Source with my cousins at their LAN parties or learning every corner of how Windows XP work, I would always find myself in front of a computer screen being entertained for hours. 

Soon enough at the age of 12 I was given my first ever computer for my birthday and officially became the family house IT geek to fix any issues related to the internet or with my family computer. 

In 2014, I started my first ever IT classes in my Grade 10 year in highschool and began to learn how to code with Java. In those first few classes I knew instantly that this is what I wanted to do with my future and began many hours of climbing that learning curve of coding, debugging and theory. 

Once I matriculated in 2016, I was accepted into the University of Johannesburg where I began my BSc Computer Science journey. 

In 2018 I moved to the University of Pretoria to continue my studies and to complete my studies. 

In 2022 I took my official gap year and started freelancing my software skills to different people where I was shortly picked up by RIC to work on there "[BGO Tool]" solo.

I then moved onto my first passion project "[Shop Emporium]" where I created an ecommerce shop from scratch for Emporium of Curosity.
